# Projects
These are some of my small coding projects/assignments that have come from my coursework.

If you would just like to see some highlights so far, look at the following:

"Poker Probability Analysis with New Class in Python.py"

"TED_Talks JSON Analysis.py"

"SMS Store Manager.py"

Currently, I am working on an independet data project to model player success and to predict tournament outcomes based on past tennis matches, where I will be querying from thousands of data points, including match scores, player rankings, and player statistics.
